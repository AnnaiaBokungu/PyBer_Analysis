# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
For the present analysis, we were required to create a few summary data frames representing different aspects if the ride-sharing data by city type. Data related to total weekly fares, for each city were visually represenated by a linegraph and other data related to fares and drivers in each city can be found within the .ypnb file associated with this repository.
### Results 
The results from out anlysis indicate that urban cities had highest number of fares, followed by suburban cities, and lasty by rural cities.The total fares for urban cities ranged from 1500 to 2000 ($), which is far larger than the fares from rural cities which only fell between 0-500($). Suburban cities fares ranged from $500 to $1000 which falls right in between the other two types previously discussed.
### Summary
Given that the majority of the fare revenue originated from urban cities, there should be a focus on having more drivers within those types of cities, however, it would be smart to consider that those in more rural areas might not have as much accessibility to drivers within their area. This could be an explanation for such low numbers in fares.
